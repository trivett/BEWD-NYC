# Let's make an array of hashes to represent news stories in Teddit.



# #first, literally write three hashes of stories into a news array. Each story
# hash should have headline, category, and upvotes. If you want some
# inspiration, go for The Onion or something. 


#create a hash that saves each of these values

# # prompt the user to enter a new story headline, then a category, and then
# number of upvotes.


# make a method that accepts a story as a parameter.
# The method should print each story with the following format: 
# Headline: Obama Invites Pizza Rat to White House
# Category: Politics
# Upvotes: 90

# print_story(news_story)



#
# Call the method on the variable that saves the user-submitted story

# ================== step two ================
# Push the hash of the user-created story into the array you defined earlier. You
# can use either the .push method or that awesome shovel << method to do it.

# let's iterate over the array of hashes and pass each (hint hint) one into the
# method that prints them out all pretty.
