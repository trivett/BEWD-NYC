# Let's make an array of hashes to represent news stories in Teddit.

#first, literally write three hashes of stories into a news array. Each story hash should have headline, category, and upvotes

# prompt the user to enter a new story headline, then a category, and then number of upvotes.

# push the new story into the news array.

#iterate over the news array and print each story with the following format: 
# Headline: Obama Invites Pizza Rat to White House
# Category: Politics
# Upvotes: 90
