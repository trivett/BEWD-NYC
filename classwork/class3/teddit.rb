# I'm sure we have all noticed that on sites like Reddit and Twitter, anything involving a cat seems to get a lot of attention.
# This program will prompt the user for a headline, scan the headline for the word "cat" and the program will automatically assign fake upvotes to the story if there is the mention of a cat.


# first, lets declare a method that will scan the story for the word cat or bacon. Let's name it calculate_upvotes


# it's return value should be the number of upvotes, which should default to one
# let's check the ruby docs for a method that checks whether a substring (part of a string) is included in a string.


# now let's prompt the user to put in a news headline



# Save the user input as the variable story



# print the story and it's appropriate upvotes.

# what about if a headline has cat AND bacon?
