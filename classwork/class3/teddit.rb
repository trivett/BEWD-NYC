# I'm sure we have all noticed that on sites like Reddit and Twitter, anything involving a cat seems to get a lot of attention.
# This program will prompt the user for a headline, scan the headline for the word "cat" and the user will and automatically assign fake upvotes to the story if there is the mention of a cat.


# prompt the user to enter a headline


# save the headline as a variable and "gets.chomp" the headline from the user

# set an upvotes variable. Where should the number of upvotes start? 





# define a method that scans for the word cat, and pass in the headline that the user gave you, and the upvotes variable.

# call the method so something happens!

# print to the screen the story and number of upvotes.
