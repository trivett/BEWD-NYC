#Homework 2

##1. Make the bouncer a tiny bit smarter

* Edit the bouncer.rb file that we made in class.
* Make the program ask the user his or her age
* Pass the age variable into a method called check_age
* check_age should evaluate whether the user is allowed into the bar and print a message to the screen
* Remember that user input will always be a string, but this needs to become an integer to be compared to other integers

##2. Evens and Odds
* Prompt the user for an integer and test if it’s even or odd. Consider using the way Ruby rounds operations on integers when appropriate. Save this program in a file called compare.rb.


##3. Calculator
* In class, we made a boring calculator that only adds.
* start with user input that should work as so:
````
What would you like to do? ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide')
add
Enter the first number:
2
Enter the second number:
2
The answer is 4.
````
* Create five methods in this file for add, subtract, multiply, divide and
  moduluar division.
* What if the user types an invalid input like "schmooosh?"
