-- In your words, explain how the loop in tunr.rb works to let the user continually keep playing new songs or requesting new song lists.

- Based on the flag = Y , it promt user what they want to do, they can play or show band. When users enters P to play, it promt users to enter a band name. When user enter a band name with a space for example, backstreet boys, that where .gsub come in play, it replaces spalce with (+) and it loops play_random_song_from_band.quit
