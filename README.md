# BEWD-NYC
Homework and instructional material for GA's Back End Web Development course starting Nov 2015

##Welcome to Back End Web Development!

This repo will hold my class notes and slides, as well as assignments for
in-class labs and homework. 

Please fork this repository and clone your fork to your local laptop.

Add this as an upstream repository like so: 
`$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:trivett/BEWD-NYC.git`

1. Pull the instructors' changes (adding homework assignments for instance) from
   upstream into your fork:
   
	`git pull upstream master`
  
2. Navigate to the folder called `assignments/` and find the relevant homework assignment for today. For example:

	`cp -r assignments/class2/YOURNAME/`
	
	or
	
	`cp assignments/class2/be_the_interpreter.rb YOURNAME/class2`

	Of course, please replace YOURNAME with your actual name. DO NOT MAKE CHANGES IN OTHER STUDENTS' FOLDERS!

3. Make your edits on the files in your folder, and use `git add .`, `git commit -m `, and `git push origin master` to push the changes up to your fork of the homework repo.
4. Issue a pull request on github from your fork to the upstream repo, trivett/BEWD_NYC
5. The instructors will review your code, leave comments, and merge your code in when you get it right.
