# BEWD-NYC
Homework and instructional material for GA's Back End Web Development course starting Nov 2015

##Welcome to Back End Web Development!

This repo will hold my class notes and slides, as well as assignments for
in-class labs and homework. 

Please fork this repository and clone your fork to your local laptop.

Add this as an upstream repository like so: 
`$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:trivett/BEWD-NYC.git`

1. Pull the instructors' changes (adding homework assignments for instance) from
   upstream into your fork:
   
	`git pull upstream master`
  
2. Navigate to the folder called `assignments/` and find the relevant homework assignment for today. For example:

	`cp -r assignments/class2/YOURNAME/`
	
	or
	
	`cp assignments/class2/be_the_interpreter.rb YOURNAME/class2`

	Of course, please replace YOURNAME with your actual name. DO NOT MAKE CHANGES OUTSIDE OF YOUR FOLDER!
	
	To make sure that you aren't committing extra stuff, please remember to pull from upstream before you start work and consider running `git checkout -- classwork/` to discard changes in that directory. 

3. Make your edits on the files in your folder, and use `git add .` or `git add path/to/file/you/edited.rb`. Then  `git commit -m "message here"`, and `git push origin master` to push the changes up to your fork of the homework repo.
4. Issue a pull request on github from your fork to the upstream repo, trivett/BEWD_NYC
5. The instructors will review your code, leave comments, and merge your code in when you get it right.
